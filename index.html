                <h2>Static Web Pages</h2>
                <p>Just the header, paragraph, and styling HTML tags</p>

                <h2>Static Web Pages</h2>
                <p>Web clients were also very simple, with a lot just rendering HTML through a terminal output</p>

            <!-- Dynamic Websites -->
            <section data-auto-animate>
                <h2>Dynamic Web Pages</h2>
                <p>Static pages are boring though, so some people got to thinking and came up with a way to make websites
                    more dynamic and interactive. This was the birth of using HTTP headers to
                    send data to the server and have it generate a new page on the fly.
                </p>

            <section data-auto-animate>
                <h2>Dynamic Web Pages</h2>
                <p>Dynamiticity was usually done by using Query Parameters in the URL, setting custom HTTP headers,
                    and/or sending data in the body of the request via a POST request like when a user submits a form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since this became pretty standardized, developers started to create libraries and frameworks to
                    make this easier. This was the birth of CGI (Common Gateway Interface).

            <!-- Interactive and Styled Pages -->
            <section data-auto-animate>
               <h2>Interactive Web Pages</h2>
               <p>Before, HTML was forced into a linear format of either inline or blocked elements.
                   With the advent of CSS and JavaScript though, developers were able to change the 
                   ordering and look of elements, as well as the behavior that happens when users
                   interact with the page.

            <section data-auto-animate>
                <h2>Interactive Web Pages</h2>
                <p>This brought about a whole new era of web development with the ability to create
                    dynamic and interactive web pages.
                </p>
            </section>

            <!-- The Age of the Modern Web -->
            <section data-auto-animate>
                <h2>The Modern Web</h2>
                <p>With the advent of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), developers were able to
                    send and receive data from the server without having to reload the page. This was
                    a huge step forward in creating more dynamic and interactive web applications.
                </p>

                <small>AJAX is actually still heavily in use today, 20 years later, believe it or not; it's also noted as THE key reason Gmail became such a success!</small>

            <section data-auto-animate>
                <h2>The Modern Web</h2>
                <p>Now, in around 2003-2007, load balancing and server-side caching became more popular
                    as websites started to get more and more traffic. This was the birth of the modern web
                    and the start of the era of web applications.
                </p>
                <p class="fragment">
                    Infrastructure also started to become more complex, with the introduction of load balancers and reverse proxies.
                    Spreading your database across multiple regions also became more popular as well as the use of CDNs 
                    (Content Delivery Networks) to cache and serve static assets.
                </p>

            <!-- The Advent of Async -->
            <section data-auto-animate>
                <h2>The Advent of Asynchronous Programming</h2>
                <p>With the increasing amount of traffic and infrastructure to deal with, developers started to run into issues with
                    blocking code. This was the birth of the idea of asynchronous programming, where code could run
                    in the background and not block the main thread from accepting new requests.
                </p>
                <p class="fragment">
                    Eventually, Node.js was created, which allowed developers to write server-side code in JavaScript
                    and use the same language on the frontend and backend while being very performant I/O wise compared
                    to other server-side languages which had lack luster async support.
                </p>
            </section>
            <!-- The Advent of Virtual DOMs -->
            <section>
                <h2>The Advent of Virtual DOMs</h2>
                <p>With the increasing complexity of web applications, the frontend was starting to get complex too; so
                    developers started to create libraries and frameworks to help manage the complexity. This was the
                    birth of the idea of the Virtual DOM.
                </p>
                <p class="fragment">What it allowed developers to do was to create a virtual representation of the DOM in memory and then
                    compare it to the actual DOM on the page. If there were any differences, it would only update the
                    parts that needed to be updated, rather than re-rendering the entire page.
                </p>
                <p class="fragment">This  was the birth of frontend libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.</p>

            <!-- Web Development Today -->
            <section>
                <h2>Web Development Today</h2>
                <p>Today, web development is a complex and ever-changing field. With the advent of cloud computing, serverless
                    architecture, and the increasing complexity of web applications, developers are constantly having to
                    learn new technologies and paradigms to keep up with the industry.
                </p>
                <p class="fragment">You could instantly scale your app to 7 continents using serverless, do machine learning in
                    the browser using WebAssembly, make a game using WebGPU API or ThreeJS, etc. The field has never been more
                    exciting and full of possibilities.
